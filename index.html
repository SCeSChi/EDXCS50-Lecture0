  <h1>What are these pages about?</h1>
  <h2>Edx Course</h2>
  <div>This is a small project that is used to become more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
    <br>And why am I following through it? Because it is a first step towards a bigger web project of course. I'll talk about it in one of the four pages that I am required to prepare here. I'll keep the work at the very minimum because I'm already late with the course.
