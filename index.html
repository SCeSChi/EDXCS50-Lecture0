  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>This is a HTML/CSS project that follows the requirements dictated by <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/">CS50 Web Course</a>. It consists of four pages:
    <ul>
    <li>In this page you will find all requirements and some notes about their fulfillment</li>
    <li>Some notes about why I like coding and how I intend to improve in this field.</li>
    <li>A page about counseling particularly putting attention on what I mean with this word. I suspect that in Italy it has a slightly different meaning than in USA</li>
    <li>This page will contain my curriculum vitae. I am exploring the difference between cv and resume. So if I find the time, I'll write a resume as developer and one as life counselor and then I'll come back here on the first page to compare my cv with two different resumes.</li>
</div>
