# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a personal webpage that I prepare for EDX Course. I use this project for:
* write my curriculum vitae in english
* explain what I like in coding
* explain what I like in life counseling
All details about content and requirement are written on the index page.

Please forgive my english, I'm Italian and I need more practice in writing.


As required, I include in this file a note for each file:
* index.html => the beginning and the place where I highlight requirements and their fulfillment
