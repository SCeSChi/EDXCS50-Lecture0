  <h1>What are these pages about?</h1>
  <h2>Edx Course</h2>
  <div>This is a small project that is used to become more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
    <br>And why am I following through it? Because it is a first step towards a bigger web project of course. I'll talk about it in one of the four pages that I am required to prepare here. I'll keep the work at the very minimum because I'm already late with the course.

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks. </li>
      <p class="fatti">ok, there is a navigation bar on each of the four pages</p>
      <li>Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.</li>
      <p class="fatti">The list is here, the table is in my CSS test page, the image is on past page</p>
      <li>Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.</li>
      <p class="fatti">I use the same stylesheet for every page, it's easy to see it</p>
      <li>Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.</li>
      <div class="fatti">
        <ul>
        <li>Five different CSS properties => background-color, font-family, border, width, padding... just the first five I used </li>
        <li>Five different types of CSS selectors => .class, #id, element, "#tableCSSTest td, #tableCSSTest th", .fatti ul, [class*="col-"]</li>
        <li>#id selector at least once => tableCSSTest for <a href="my_CSS_test.html">this table</a></li>
        <li>.class selector at least once => this list has class=fatti and its selector is .fatti </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <li>Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.</li>
      <p class="fatti">It's just a test: I add padding for screen size >400px </p>
      <li>You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap's grid model.</li>
      <p class="fatti">I think that the use of Bootstrap is evident... I use the Boostrap's grid model on <a href="main_project.html">this page</a></p>
      <li>Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.</li>
      <li>In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what's contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.</li>
    </ul>
